mdsvex:
- Understand that mdsvex is a markdown preprocessor for Svelte components.
- Key features and usage:
  1. Allows use of Svelte components in markdown, or markdown in Svelte components.
  2. Supports all Svelte syntax and almost all markdown syntax.

- Installation:
  - Install as a dev-dependency: npm i --save-dev mdsvex or yarn add --dev mdsvex

- Usage:
  1. As a Svelte preprocessor (preferred method):
     - Import: import { mdsvex } from "mdsvex";
     - Add to Svelte config (e.g., in rollup or webpack):

  2. Direct compilation (without Svelte compiler):
     - Import: import { compile } from "mdsvex";
     - Usage: const transformed_code = await compile(mdsvexSource, mdsvexOptions);

- Configuration Options:
  1. extensions: string[] = [\".svx\"]
     - Set custom file extensions for mdsvex files.

  2. smartypants: boolean | smartypantsOptions = true
     - Transforms ASCII punctuation into fancy typographic punctuation HTML entities.

  3. layout: string | { [name: string]: string }
     - Provide custom layout components to wrap mdsvex content.

  4. remarkPlugins: Array<plugin> | Array<[plugin, plugin_options]>
     - Add remark plugins to enhance markdown processing.

  5. rehypePlugins: Array<plugin> | Array<[plugin, plugin_options]>
     - Add rehype plugins to enhance HTML processing.

  6. highlight: { highlighter: Function, alias: { [alias]: string } }
     - Custom syntax highlighting for code blocks.

  7. frontmatter: { parse: Function, marker: string }
     - Customize frontmatter parsing and markers.

- Layouts:
  - Can be used to wrap mdsvex content with a Svelte component.
  - Layouts receive frontmatter values as props.
  - Can define custom components to replace default HTML elements.

- Frontmatter:
  - YAML frontmatter supported by default.
  - Variables defined in frontmatter are available directly in the component.
  - Exported as metadata object from context="module" script.

- Custom Components:
  - Define in layout file's context="module" script.
  - Named exports correspond to HTML elements to replace.

- Integrations:
  - Can be integrated with syntax highlighters like Shiki.

When using mdsvex in a SvelteKit project:
1. Ensure proper configuration in svelte.config.js.
2. Use .svx or custom extension for mdsvex files.
3. Import mdsvex files as Svelte components.
4. Utilize layouts for consistent styling and structure.
5. Leverage frontmatter for metadata and dynamic content.
6. Implement custom components when needed for specialized rendering.
